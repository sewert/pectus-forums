# pectus-forums
This site is very much a work in progress. It was created in response to the news that the forums hosted at <a href="https://www.pectus.com">pectus.com</a> shut down on April 1, 2019.

I initially thought to build a new forum here to support the pectus community. However, I have since learned that reddit already has active pectus communities at https://www.reddit.com/r/PectusExcavatum and https://www.reddit.com/r/PectusCarinatum.

Because reddit will most likely remain free forever, I think its best to refer users to reddit instead of creating an additional forum.

Feel free to make requests or submit code changes.
